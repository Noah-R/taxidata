My conclusions from these scripts:

Measured based on number of trips, the most common combination of pickup and dropoff zones are the four combinations of 236 and 237(Upper East Side between 3rd and 5th Avenues, 59th to 96th Streets). Trips to and from each combination were more than twice as frequent as any other combination.

Measured based on miles driven, the most common trips are all from and to airports. The single most miles were driven from 132(JFK Airport) to 230(Times Square).

Measured based on money spent, the most common trips are a more mixed combination of these two types.

Above patterns were measured for December 2019, the last month of data available as of writing. Patterns held up similarly when measured in June, although December seems to have more UES trips than June, despite having the same number of total trips.

Based on this, the three biggest trip vectors seem to be trips from(and to a lesser extent to) the airports, from(and to, if from the airport) midtown, and the Upper East Side zones 236/237.

Year over year analysis, measured from June 2018 to June 2019:

Overall trips were down 21.6%.

The biggest year over year increase were trips originating in zone 70. Presumably this is because of traffic pattern changes at LaGuardia Airport due to construction and congestion, moving some taxi service out of the airport complex(zone 138) into FHV lots in this zone.

A reverse effect was observed from zone 138. These trips decreased to a lesser percentage, but by a significantly higher amount, which suggests that some other factor, likely based on air traffic, was in play.

Trips within JFK(zone 132) and LGA(zone 138), as well as between the two, were up for some reason.

There was an order of magnitude increase in trips from LGA(both 70 and 138) and JFK(132) to zone 93(Flushing Meadows-Corona Park)

There was an order of magnitude increase in trips from LGA(especially 70 but also 138) to Richmond Hill(197) and South Ozone Park(216). There was a smaller increase to thse zones from JFK(132).

The biggest year over year decrease was in trips to LGA(138) from Steinway(223). Presumably this is due to increasing adoption of Q70 Select Bus Service to LGA.

Hails decreased by more than half in Queens Village(191), Williamsburg(255 and 256), Greenpoint(112), and Prospect Park(190). The cause of this warrants further inquiry.

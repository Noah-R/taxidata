This repository uses TLC trip record data, which is not uploaded here due to size constraints. It is available at https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page

This data provides records, in csv format, of every taxi trip taken in New York City, organized by month. It denotes where each trip starts and ends, in the form of one of the 263 zones it splits the city into. It also provides other metadata, including the start and end time of the trip, the distance travelled, and the amount and type of payment.

The analyses in this repository use data from both yellow taxis, which operate throughout the city, and green taxis, which are specifically forbidden from picking up passengers in Manhattan below West 110th Street or East 96th Street. Data is also available for for-hire vehicles(IE Uber, Lyft, black car services), but it is significantly larger, less detailed, and likely less reliable, so it is not used here.
